I am an architect and researcher working at the intersection of architectural geometry, 
structural systems, and AI-driven design workflows. My work explores how deep learning 
models can extract spatial and pattern-based information from architectural data and 
translate it into measurable metrics and generative design systems.

My current research focuses on facade analysis, entropy-based regularity, surface-active 
structures, and the integration of machine learning with computational geometry tools 
such as Python and Rhino.

Research interests:
- AI-driven architectural design
- Computational geometry and surface-active systems
- Deep learning for pattern extraction and metric-driven design
- Data-driven facade analysis (WWR, regularity, entropy)
- Design-to-fabrication workflows

Selected work:
- AI-Driven Facade Design Workshop  
  CycleGAN-based facade analysis → WWR & regularity metrics → Rhino geometry workflows

This GitHub serves as a research notebook and teaching archive.
