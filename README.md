Architect · Computational Design · AI-Driven Architecture

I am an architect and researcher working at the intersection of architectural geometry, 
structural systems, and computational design. My work explores how deep learning models 
can extract spatial and pattern-based information from architectural data and translate 
it into measurable metrics and generative design systems.

My current research focuses on facade analysis, entropy-based regularity, surface-active 
structures, and the integration of machine learning with computational geometry tools 
such as Python and Rhino.

**Research Interests**
- AI-driven architectural design
- Facade analysis and pattern metrics (WWR, entropy)
- Deep learning in design workflows
- Computational geometry and surface patterning
- Data-driven generative design

### Featured Work
- **AI-Driven Facade Design Workshop** — CycleGAN facade analysis → WWR & regularity → CSV → Rhino geometry workflows
- **IBM AI Engineering Capstone Project** — Applied ML pipeline including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and model evaluation and deployment considerations (IBM AI Engineering Programme)
